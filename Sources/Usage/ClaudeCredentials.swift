/// (or a refresh whose keychain writeback fails) invalidates the user's

///     because a refresh re-issues the same scope set — only a fresh
///     `claude /login` can recover a missing `user:profile`.
///   - A rate-limited probe short-circuits from ANY source: the limiter is
///     keyed per account, not per token (anthropics/claude-code#30930), so
///     trying another token only feeds the limiter.
